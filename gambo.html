                    This was a project that I worked on in twelfth grade with <a href="rsnous.com">Omar Rizwan</a>.

                    We thought it would be fun to build an emulator as means of learning more about computer architecture. We selected the GameBoy because the platform had enough complexity to be interesting while still being easy to understand. The GameBoy is based around a modified version of a Zilog Z80, and the operations of the system are <a href=http://problemkaputt.de/pandocs.htm">very well documented</a>.

                    <p>
                    We wrote the program in Java since we planned to port it to Android, and much of our code was written with multiple target platforms in mind. We later discovered that Java was too slow to run the emulator well on Android. Existing Android GameBoy emulators are mostly written in C using the JNI, However, we were able to use Google Web Toolkit to create a web version (above) with very little additional code.
