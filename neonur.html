                    As part of the 2014 SUNFEST REU, I worked with Dr. Jay Zemel on the NeoNur, which is a cheap, portable device for recording the feeding characteristics of infants.

                    Devices to monitor various feeding characteristics of infants have existed for many years, but they were not portable and difficult to use outside of research lab. The NeoNur uses modern embedded systems technology to record the internal pressure sensor of the bottle during the feeding process. When the child bites down on the nipple of the bottle, the volume of the system decreases, which increases the internal pressure of the system. As fluid flows out of the bottle while the child is sucking, the internal pressure of the system decreases. The strength of these two actions corresponds proportionally with the magnitude of the measured pressure. Moreover, since biting and sucking normally occur one after the other, the resulting pressure signal is sinusoidal in nature. These two properties provide a wealth of information for medical researchers to analyze.

                    <p>
                    I developed the companion software to the device, which included a user interface for downloading and storing the data from the NeoNur's internal memory unit and a GUI suite for performing analysis of the recorded data with various DSP techniques. I also worked with the embedded software onboard the device, though to a lesser extent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The NeoNur and my software is being used by roughly a dozen hospitals as a research tool.
