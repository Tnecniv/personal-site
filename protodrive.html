                    As my Embedded Systems semester project, I worked on a hardware platform for testing the power control systems for electric vehicles. The project was essentially a sequel to an Protodrive created by a pervious year's group, but our version featured a more advanced control of the hybrid power supply.

                    A conventional vehicle can waste large amounts of energy when a driver slows his vehicle by easing off the accelerator. The extra kinetic energy in the system dissipates into the environment as the car decelerates. However, with an electrical motor part of this energy can be recaptured by a process called regenerative braking. In regenerative breaking, the back EMF of the motor's inductor is used to charge a supercapacitor. Capacitors alone cannot provide enough energy to power a vehicle for a long trip. Instead, they are often used to supplement a battery when high levels of current are needed to drive the motor, like when the vehicle is travelling up a steep hill. Instead of the battery delivering the full potentially damaging current load, the capacitor can provide some portion of the current to keep the current through the battery at a safe level.

                    The Protodrive provides a hardware platform to test the control code for this type of hybrid power system. The device has two coupled motors. The first represents the vehicle's motor, and the other represents the load present on that motor by the terrain. A <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/">mBed</a> microcontroller serves as the hub of the system. A drive profile with speed and terrain info is sent via serial to the mBed from a computer, and it drives the motor accordingly. A buck-boost converter provides both a method for drawing variable portions of current, and recharging the capacitor during regenerative breaking. Data on the voltage of the battery and capacitor is sent back to the computer in real time.
