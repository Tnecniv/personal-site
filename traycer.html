                        I wanted to get some more experience working with Haskell, so I challenged myself to a Christmas hackathon and wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">raytracer</a>. A raytracer is a good project for working with a new language because it is complicated enough that you can fully explore a language's features within a managable project size. This particular raytracer features full Phong shading with reflective surfaces and hard shadows.

                        Working with Haskell turned out to be quite delightful. Previously, I was aware of the praise the Haskell type system received and the "if it compiles, it works" slogan that gets tossed around, but I remained skeptical. In my experience, most bugs are a mistake in your logic or algorithm, not a typing issue. However, after spending some time with Haskell, I realized that the beauty of the type system is that your data structures <em>express the logic of the problem you are trying to solve</em>. While it doesn't prevent every bug, the type system allows for a certain clarity of thought and a strictness that helps ensure the code you write adheres to your intentions.
